# Skyrim SE/AE

- Steam version of the game
- Manual modding - mostly ESP files activated and sorted withing Skyrim's Creations menu + Creation Club content
- SKSE is run from Skyrim "Play" button on Steam, no non-steam game

Following mod list is meant to improve Skyrim by enhancing the graphics, adding few QoL features, making some gameplay changes and adding minor amount of new content. Trying to keep mod list as lean as possible. Many of the mods are my preference and can be skipped, but the guide will hopefully work for anyone.

## Instructions

1. Clean install - reinstall the game if needed + delete its prefix
2. Run the game once, configure graphics settings, run the game and wait for AE CC stuff to download, then quit the game
3. Download mods from nexus manually
4. Manually "install" SKSE (copy files to Skyrim folder)
5. Open Skyrim Special Edition folder and rename `SkyrimSELauncher.exe` to `SkyrimSELauncher.exe.bak`, then rename `skse64_loader.exe` to `SkyrimSELauncher.exe`
6. Launch Skyrim from steam, to ensure it works.
